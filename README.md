## Teapot Not Found Poker

The game is a variation of video poker, and an entry for the 2020 Js13kGames coding golf. The 2020 theme is "404". That's where it took its name and slightly tweaked rules.   

### Gameplay

As the game related  to **404**, it's quite logical ðŸ™‚ that pair of Fours or less don't count.
